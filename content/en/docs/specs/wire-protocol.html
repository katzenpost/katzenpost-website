<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>This document defines the Katzenpost Mix Network Wire Protocol for
use in all network communications to, from, and within the Katzenpost
Mix Network.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>The Katzenpost Mix Network Wire Protocol (KMNWP) is the custom wire
protocol for all network communications to, from, and within the
Katzenpost Mix Network. This protocol provides mutual authentication,
and an additional layer of cryptographic security and forward
secrecy.</p>
<h2 id="conventions-used-in-this-document">1.1 Conventions Used in This
Document</h2>
<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <a
href="#RFC2119">RFC2119</a>.</p>
<p>The “C” style Presentation Language as described in <a
href="#RFC5246">RFC5246</a> Section 4 is used to represent data
structures, except for cryptographic attributes, which are specified as
opaque byte vectors.</p>
<p><code>x | y</code> denotes the concatenation of x and y.</p>
<h2 id="key-encapsulation-mechanism">1.2 Key Encapsulation
Mechanism</h2>
<p>This protocol uses ANY Key Encapsulation Mechanism. However it’s
recommended that most users select a hybrid post quantum KEM such as
Xwing. <a href="#XWING">XWING</a></p>
<h1 id="core-protocol">2. Core Protocol</h1>
<p>The protocol is based on Kyber and Trevor Perrin’s Noise Protocol
Framework <a href="#NOISE">NOISE</a> along with “Post Quantum Noise”
paper <a href="#PQNOISE">PQNOISE</a>. Older previous versions of our
transport were based on <a href="#NOISEHFS">NOISEHFS</a>.</p>
<p>Our transport protocol begins with a prologue, Noise handshake,
followed by a stream of Noise Transport messages in a minimal framing
layer, over a TCP/IP connection.</p>
<p>Our Noise protocol is configurable via the KEM selection in the TOML
configuration files, here’s an example PQ Noise protocol string:</p>
<pre><code>Noise_pqXX_Xwing_ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2b</code></pre>
<p>The protocol string is a very condensed description of our protocol.
We use the pqXX two way Noise pattern which is described as follows:</p>
<pre><code>pqXX: -&gt; e &lt;- ekem, s -&gt; skem, s &lt;- skem</code></pre>
<p>The next part of the protocol string specifies the KEM,
<code>Xwing</code> which is a hybrid KEM where the share secret outputs
of both X25519 and MLKEM768 are combined.</p>
<p>Finally the <code>ChaChaPoly_BLAKE2b</code> parts of the protocol
string indicate which stream cipher and hash function we are using.</p>
<p>As a non-standard modification to the Noise protocol, the 65535 byte
message length limit is increased to 1300000 bytes. We send very large
messages over our Noise protocol because of our using the Sphincs+
signature scheme which has signatures that are about 49k bytes.</p>
<p>It is assumed that all parties using the KMNWP protocol have a fixed
long or short lived <code>Xwing</code> keypair <a
href="#XWING">XWING</a>, the public component of which is known to the
other party in advance. How such keys are distributed is beyond the
scope of this document.</p>
<h2 id="handshake-phase">2.1 Handshake Phase</h2>
<p>All sessions start in the Handshake Phase, in which an anonymous
authenticated handshake is conducted.</p>
<p>The handshake is a unmodified Noise handshake, with a fixed prologue
prefacing the initiator's first Noise handshake message. This prologue
is also used as the <code>prologue</code> input to the Noise
HandshakeState <code>Initialize()</code> operation for both the
initiator and responder.</p>
<p>The prologue is defined to be the following structure:</p>
<pre><code>struct {
    uint8_t protocol_version; /* 0x03 */
} Prologue;</code></pre>
<p>As all Noise handshake messages are fixed sizes, no additional
framing is required for the handshake.</p>
<p>Implementations MUST preserve the Noise handshake hash
<code>[h]</code> for the purpose of implementing authentication (Section
2.3).</p>
<p>Implementations MUST reject handshake attempts by terminating the
session immediately upon any Noise protocol handshake failure and when,
as a responder, they receive a Prologue containing an unknown
protocol_version value.</p>
<p>Implementations SHOULD impose reasonable timeouts for the handshake
process, and SHOULD terminate sessions that are taking too long to
handshake.</p>
<h2 id="handshake-authentication">2.1.1 Handshake Authentication</h2>
<p>Mutual authentication is done via exchanging fixed sized payloads as
part of the <code>pqXX</code> handshake consisting of the following
structure:</p>
<pre><code>struct {
    uint8_t ad_len;
    opaque additional_data[ad_len];
    opaque padding[255 - ad_len];
    uint32_t unix_time;
} AuthenticateMessage;</code></pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ad_len</code> - The length of the optional additional
data.</li>
<li><code>additional_data</code> - Optional additional data, such as a
username, if any.</li>
<li><code>unix_time</code> - 0 for the initiator, the approximate number
of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC for the responder.</li>
</ul>
<p>The initiator MUST send the <code>AuthenticateMessage</code> after it
has received the peer's response (so after <code>-&gt; s, se</code> in
Noise parlance).</p>
<p>The contents of the optional <code>additional_data</code> field is
deliberately left up to the implementation, however it is RECOMMENDED
that implementations pad the field to be a consistent length regardless
of contents to avoid leaking information about the authenticating
identity.</p>
<p>To authenticate the remote peer given an AuthenticateMessage, the
receiving peer must validate the <code>s</code> component of the Noise
handshake (the remote peer's long term public key) with the known value,
along with any of the information in the <code>additional_data</code>
field such as the user name, if any.</p>
<p>If the validation procedure succeeds, the peer is considered
authenticated. If the validation procedure fails for any reason, the
session MUST be terminated immediately.</p>
<p>Responders MAY add a slight amount (+- 10 seconds) of random noise to
the unix_time value to avoid leaking precise load information via packet
queueing delay.</p>
<h2 id="data-transfer-phase">2.2 Data Transfer Phase</h2>
<p>Upon successfully concluding the handshake the session enters the
Data Transfer Phase, where the initiator and responder can exchange
KMNWP messages.</p>
<p>A KMNWP message is defined to be the following structure:</p>
<pre><code>enum {
    no_op(0),
    disconnect(1),
    send_packet(2),

    (255),
} Command;

struct {
    Command command;
    uint8_t reserved;    /* MUST be &#39;0x00&#39; */
    uint32_t msg_length; /* 0 &lt;= msg_length &lt;= 1048554) */
    opaque message[msg_length];
    opaque padding[];    /* length is implicit */
} Message;</code></pre>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The padding field, if any MUST be padded with <code>'0x00'</code>
bytes.</li>
</ul>
<p>All outgoing Message(s) are encrypted and authenticated into a pair
of Noise Transport messages, each containing one of the following
structures:</p>
<pre><code>struct {
    uint32_t message_length;
} CiphertextHeader;

struct {
    uint32_t message[ciphertext_length-16];
} Ciphertext;</code></pre>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>ciphertext_length</code> field includes the Noise protocol
overhead of 16 bytes, for the Noise Transport message containing the
Ciphertext.</li>
</ul>
<p>All outgoing Message(s) are preceded by a Noise Transport Message
containing a <code>CiphertextHeader</code>, indicating the size of the
Noise Transport Message transporting the Message Ciphertext. After
generating both Noise Transport Messages, the sender MUST call the Noise
CipherState <code>Rekey()</code> operation.</p>
<p>To receive incoming Ciphertext messages, first the Noise Transport
Message containing the CiphertextHeader is consumed off the network,
authenticated and decrypted, giving the receiver the length of the Noise
Transport Message containing the actual message itself. The second Noise
Transport Message is consumed off the network, authenticated and
decrypted, with the resulting message being returned to the caller for
processing. After receiving both Noise Transport Messages, the receiver
MUST call the Noise CipherState <code>Rekey()</code> operation.</p>
<p>Implementations MUST immediately terminate the session any of the
<code>DecryptWithAd()</code> operations fails.</p>
<p>Implementations MUST immediately terminate the session if an unknown
command is received in a Message, or if the Message is otherwise
malformed in any way.</p>
<p>Implementations MAY impose a reasonable idle timeout, and terminate
the session if it expires.</p>
<h1 id="predefined-commands">3. Predefined Commands</h1>
<h2 id="the-no_op-command">3.1 The no_op Command</h2>
<p>The <code>no_op</code> command is a command that explicitly is a No
Operation, to be used to implement functionality such as keep-alives and
or application layer padding.</p>
<p>Implementations MUST NOT send any message payload accompanying this
command, and all received command data MUST be discarded without
interpretation.</p>
<h2 id="the-disconnect-command">3.2 The disconnect Command</h2>
<p>The <code>disconnect</code> command is a command that is used to
signal explicit session termination. Upon receiving a disconnect
command, implementations MUST interpret the command as a signal from the
peer that no additional commands will be sent, and destroy the
cryptographic material in the receive CipherState.</p>
<p>While most implementations will likely wish to terminate the session
upon receiving this command, any additional behavior is explicitly left
up to the implementation and application.</p>
<p>Implementations MUST NOT send any message payload accompanying this
command, and MUST not send any further traffic after sending a
disconnect command.</p>
<h2 id="the-send_packet-command">3.3 The send_packet Command</h2>
<p>The <code>send_packet</code> command is the command that is used by
the initiator to transmit a Sphinx Packet over the network. The
command’s message is the Sphinx Packet destined for the responder.</p>
<p>Initiators MUST terminate the session immediately upon reception of a
<code>send_packet</code> command.</p>
<h1 id="command-padding">4. Command Padding</h1>
<p>We use traffic padding to hide from a passive network observer which
command has been sent or received.</p>
<p>Among the set of padded commands we exclude the
<code>Consensus</code> command because it’s contents are a very large
payload which is usually many times larger than our Sphinx packets.
Therefore we only pad these commands:</p>
<p>GetConsensus NoOp Disconnect SendPacket RetrieveMessage MessageACK
Message MessageEmpty</p>
<p>However we split them up into two directions, client to server and
server to client because they differ in size due to the difference in
size between <code>SendPacket</code> and <code>Message</code>:</p>
<p>Client to Server commands:</p>
<p>NoOp SendPacket Disconnect RetrieveMessage GetConsensus</p>
<p>Server to client commands:</p>
<p>Message MessageACK MessageEmpty</p>
<p>The <code>GetConsensus</code> command is a special case because we
only want to pad it when it’s sent over the mixnet. We don’t want to pad
it when sending to the dirauths. Although it would not be so terrible if
it’s padded when sent to the dirauths… it would just needlessly take up
bandwidth without providing any privacy benefits.</p>
<h1 id="anonymity-considerations">5. Anonymity Considerations</h1>
<p>Adversaries being able to determine that two parties are
communicating via KMNWP is beyond the threat model of this protocol. At
a minimum, it is trivial to determine that a KMNWP handshake is being
performed, due to the length of each handshake message, and the fixed
positions of the various public keys.</p>
<h1 id="security-considerations">6. Security Considerations</h1>
<p>It is imperative that implementations use ephemeral keys for every
handshake as the security properties of the Kyber KEM are totally lost
if keys are ever reused.</p>
<p>Kyber was chosen as the KEM algorithm due to it’s conservative
parameterization, simplicty of implementation, and high performance in
software. It is hoped that the addition of a quantum resistant algorithm
will provide forward secrecy even in the event that large scale quantum
computers are applied to historical intercepts.</p>
