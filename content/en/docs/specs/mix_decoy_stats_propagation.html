            <p> Katzenpost lets different elements in the network track whether other elements are
               functioning correctly. A node A will do this by sending packets in randomly generated
               loops through the network, and tracking whether the loop comes back or not. When it
               comes back, it will mark that as evidence, that the nodes on the path of that loop
               are
               functioning correctly. </p>

               at faulty nodes should approach 0 (if the node doesn&#x2019;t work at all), and be binomially
               distributed at nodes that can share a loop with faulty nodes. </p>

            <p> The report is subsequently uploaded to the directory authorities, which combine the
               reports of individual nodes into a health status of the network and arrive at a
               consensus decision about the topology of the network. </p>
