<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>This interface is meant to provide support for various autoresponder
agents “Kaetzchen” that run on Katzenpost provider instances, thus
bypassing the need to run a discrete client instance to provide
functionality. The use-cases for such agents include, but are not
limited to, user identity key lookup, a discard address, and a loop-back
responder for the purpose of cover traffic.</p>
<h2 id="conventions-used-in-this-document">1.1 Conventions Used in This
Document</h2>
<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <code>RFC2119</code>.</p>
<h2 id="terminology">1.2. Terminology</h2>
<p><code>SURB</code> - “single use reply block” SURBs are used to
achieve recipient anonymity, that is to say, SURBs function as a
cryptographic delivery token that you can give to another client entity
so that they can send you a message without them knowing your identity
or location on the network. See <code>SPHINXSPEC</code> and
<code>SPHINX</code>.</p>
<p><code>BlockSphinxPlaintext</code> - The payload structure which is
encapsulated by the Sphinx body. It is described in
<code>KATZMIXE2E</code>, section</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Client and Provider processing of received packets</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="extension-overview">2. Extension Overview</h1>
<p>Each Kaetzchen agent will register as a potential recipient on its
Provider. When the Provider receives a forward packet destined for a
Kaetzchen instance, it will hand off the fully unwrapped packet along
with its corresponding SURB to the agent, which will then act on the
packet and optionally reply utilizing the SURB.</p>
<h1 id="agent-requirements">3. Agent Requirements</h1>
<ul>
<li>Each agent operation MUST be idempotent.</li>
<li>Each agent operation request and response MUST fit within one Sphinx
packet.</li>
<li>Each agent SHOULD register a recipient address that is prefixed with
(Or another standardized delimiter, agreed to by all participating
providers in a given mixnet).</li>
<li>Each agent SHOULD register a recipient address that consists of
a</li>
<li>RFC5322 dot-atom value, and MUST register recipient addresses that
are at most 64 octets in length.</li>
<li>The first byte of the agent's response payload MUST be 0x01 to allow
clients to easily differentiate between SURB-ACKs and agent
responses.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mix-message-formats">3.1 Mix Message Formats</h2>
<p>Messages from clients to Kaetzchen use the following payload format
in the forward Sphinx packet:</p>
<pre><code>struct {
    uint8_t flags;
    uint8_t reserved; /* Set to 0x00. */
    select (flags) {
    case 0:
    opaque padding[sizeof(SphinxSURB)];
    case 1:
    SphinxSURB surb;
    }
    opaque plaintext[];
} KaetzchenMessage;</code></pre>
<p>The plaintext component of a <code>KaetzchenMessage</code> MUST be
padded by appending “0x00” bytes to make the final total size of a
<code>KaetzchenMessage</code> equal to that of a
<code>BlockSphinxPlaintext</code>.</p>
<p>Messages (replies) from the Kaetzchen to client use the following
payload format in the SURB generated packet::</p>
<pre><code>struct {
    opaque plaintext[];
} KaetzchenReply;</code></pre>
<p>The plaintext component of a <code>KaetzchenReply</code> MUST be
padded by appending “0x00” bytes to make the final total size of a
<code>KaetzchenReply</code> equal to that of a
<code>BlockSphinxPlaintext</code></p>
<h1 id="pki-extensions">4. PKI Extensions</h1>
<p>Each provider SHOULD publish the list of publicly accessible
Kaetzchen agent endpoints in its MixDescriptor, along with any other
information required to utilize the agent.</p>
<p>Provider should make this information available in the form of a map
in which the keys are the label used to identify a given service, and
the value is a map with arbitrary keys.</p>
<p>Valid service names refer to the services defined in extensions to
this specification. Every service MUST be implemented by one and only
one Kaetzchen agent.</p>
<p>For each service, the provider MUST advertise a field for the
endpoint at which the Kaetzchen agent can be reached, as a key value
pair where the key is <code>endpoint</code>, and the value is the
provider side endpoint identifier.</p>
<pre><code>{ &quot;kaetzchen&quot;:
    { &quot;keyserver&quot; : {
            &quot;endpoint&quot;: &quot;+keyserver&quot;,
            &quot;version&quot; : 1 } },
    { &quot;discard&quot; : {
            &quot;endpoint&quot;: &quot;+discard&quot;, } },
    { &quot;loop&quot; : {
            &quot;endpoint&quot;: &quot;+loopback&quot;,
            &quot;restrictedToUsers&quot;: true } },
}</code></pre>
<h1 id="anonymity-considerations">5. Anonymity Considerations</h1>
<p>In the event that the mix keys for the entire return path are
compromised, it is possible for adversaries to unwrap the SURB and
determine the final recipient of the reply.</p>
<p>Depending on what sort of operations a given agent implements, there
may be additional anonymity impact that requires separate
consideration.</p>
<p>Clients MUST NOT have predictable retranmission otherwise this makes
active confirmations attacks possible which could be used to discover
the ingress Provider of the client.</p>
<h1 id="security-considerations">6. Security Considerations</h1>
<p>It is possible to use this mechanism to flood a victim with unwanted
traffic by constructing a request with a SURB destined for the
target.</p>
<p>Depending on the operations implemented by each agent, the added
functionality may end up being a vector for Denial of Service attacks in
the form of CPU or network overload.</p>
<p>Unless the agent implements additional encryption, message integrity
and privacy is limited to that which is provided by the base Sphinx
packet format and parameterization.</p>
