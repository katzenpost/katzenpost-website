<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>This document defines the replay detection for any protocol that uses
Sphinx cryptographic packet format. This document is meant to serve as
an implementation guide and document the existing replay protect for
deployed mix networks.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>The Sphinx cryptographic packet format is a compact and provably
secure design introduced by George Danezis and Ian Goldberg <a
href="#SPHINX09">SPHINX09</a>. Although it supports replay detection,
the exact mechanism of replay detection is neither described in <a
href="#SPHINX09">SPHINX09</a> nor is it described in our <a
href="#SPHINXSPEC">SPHINXSPEC</a>. Therefore we shall describe in detail
how to efficiently detect Sphinx packet replay attacks.</p>
<h2 id="terminology">1.1 Terminology</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>Epoch</code> - A fixed time interval defined in section “4.2
Sphinx Mix and Provider Key Rotation” of <a
href="#KATZMIXNET">KATZMIXNET</a>.</li>
<li><code>Packet</code> - A fixed-length sequence of bytes transmitted
through the network, containing the encrypted message and metadata for
routing.</li>
<li><code>Header</code> - The packet header consisting of several
components, which convey the information necessary to verify packet
integrity and correctly process the packet.</li>
<li><code>Payload</code> - The fixed-length portion of a packet
containing an encrypted message or part of a message, to be
delivered.</li>
<li><code>Group</code> - A finite set of elements and a binary operation
that satisfy the properties of closure, associativity, invertability,
and the presence of an identity element.</li>
<li><code>Group element</code> - An individual element of the
group.</li>
<li><code>Group generator</code> - A group element capable of generating
any other element of the group, via repeated applications of the
generator and the group operation.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>SEDA</code> - Staged Event Driven Architecture. <a
href="#SEDA">SEDA</a> 1. A highly parallelizable computation model. 2. A
computational pipeline composed of multiple stages connected by queues
utilizing active queue management algorithms that can evict items from
the queue based on dwell time or other criteria where each stage is a
thread pool. 3. The only correct way to efficiently implement a software
based router on general purpose computing hardware.</p>

<h1 id="sphinx-cryptographic-primitives">2. Sphinx Cryptographic
Primitives</h1>
<p>This specification borrows the following cryptographic primitives
constants from our <a href="#SPHINXSPEC">SPHINXSPEC</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>H(M)</code> - A cryptographic hash function which takes an
byte array M to produce a digest consisting of a
<code>HASH_LENGTH</code> byte array. <code>H(M)</code> MUST be pre-image
and collision resistant.</p></li>
<li><p><code>EXP(X, Y)</code> - An exponentiation function which takes
the <code>GROUP_ELEMENT_LENGTH</code> byte array group elements
<code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>, and returns <code>X ^^ Y</code> as a
<code>GROUP_ELEMENT_LENGTH</code> byte array.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let <code>G</code> denote the generator of the group, and
<code>EXP_KEYGEN()</code> return a <code>GROUP_ELEMENT_LENGTH</code>
byte array group element usable as private key.</p>
<p>The group defined by <code>G</code> and <code>EXP(X, Y)</code> MUST
satisfy the Decision Diffie-Hellman problem.</p>
<h2 id="sphinx-parameter-constants">2.1 Sphinx Parameter Constants</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>HASH_LENGTH</code> - 32 bytes. Katzenpost currently uses
SHA-512/256. <a href="#RFC6234">RFC6234</a></li>
<li><code>GROUP_ELEMENT_LENGTH</code> - 32 bytes. Katzenpost currently
uses X25519. <a href="#RFC7748">RFC7748</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="system-overview">3. System Overview</h1>
<p>Mixes as currently deployed, have two modes of operation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sphinx routing keys and replay caches are persisted to disk</li>
<li>Sphinx routing keys and replay caches are persisted to memory</li>
</ol>
<p>These two modes of operation fundamentally represent a tradeoff
between mix server availability and notional compulsion attack
resistance. Ultimately it will be the mix operator’s decision to make
since they affect the security and availability of their mix servers. In
particular since mix networks are vulnerable to the various types of
compulsion attacks (see <a href="#SPHINXSPEC">SPHINXSPEC</a> section 9.4
Compulsion Threat Considerations) and therefore there is some advantage
to NOT persisting the Sphinx routing keys to disk. The mix operator can
simply poweroff the mix server before seizure rather than physically
destroying the disk in order to prevent capture of the Sphinx routing
keys. An argument can be made for the use of full disk encryption,
however this may not be practical for servers hosted in remote
locations.</p>
<p>On the other hand, persisting Sphinx routing keys and replay caches
to disk is useful because it allows mix operators to shutdown their mix
server for maintenance purposes without loosing these Sphinx routing
keys and replay caches. This means that as soon as the maintenance
operation is completed the mix server is able to rejoin the network. Our
current PKI system <a href="#KATZMIXPKI">KATZMIXPKI</a> does NOT provide
a mechanism to notify Directory Authorities of such an outage or
maintenance period. Therefore if there is loss of Sphinx routing keys
this results in a mix outage until the next epoch.</p>
<p>The two modes of operation both completely prevent replay attacks
after a system restart. In the case of the disk persistence, replay
attacks are prevented because all packets traversing the mix have their
replay tags persisted to disk cache. This cache is therefore once again
used to prevent replays after a system restart. In the case of memory
persistence replays are prevented upon restart because the Sphinx
routing keys are destroyed and therefore the mix will not participant in
the network until at least the next epoch rotation. However availability
of the mix may require two epoch rotations because in accordance with <a
href="#KATZMIXPKI">KATZMIXPKI</a> mixes publish future epoch keys so
that Sphinx packets flowing through the network can seamlessly straddle
the epoch boundaries.</p>
<h1 id="sphinx-packet-replay-cache">4. Sphinx Packet Replay Cache</h1>
<h2 id="sphinx-replay-tag-composition">4.1 Sphinx Replay Tag
Composition</h2>
<p>The following excerpt from our <a href="#SPHINXSPEC">SPHINXSPEC</a>
shows how the replay tag is calculated.</p>
<pre><code>hdr = sphinx_packet.header
shared_secret = EXP( hdr.group_element, private_routing_key )
replay_tag = H( shared_secret )</code></pre>
<p>However this tag is not utilized in replay detection until the rest
of the Sphinx packet is fully processed and it’s header MAC verified as
described in <a href="#SPHINXSPEC">SPHINXSPEC</a>.</p>
<h1 id="sphinx-replay-tag-caching">4.2 Sphinx Replay Tag Caching</h1>
<p>It would be sufficient to use a key value store or hashmap to detect
the presence of a duplicate replay tag however we additionaly employ a
bloom filter to increase performance. Sphinx keys must periodically be
rotated and destroyed to mitigate compulsion attacks and therefore our
replay caches must likewise be rotated. This kind of key erasure scheme
limits the window of time that an adversary can perform a compulsion
attack. See our PKI specification <a href="#KATZMIXPKI">KATZMIXPKI</a>
for more details regarding epoch key rotation and the grace period
before and after the epoch boundary.</p>
<p>We tune our bloom filter for line-speed; that is to say the bloom
filter for a given replay cache is tuned for the maximum number of
Sphinx packets that can be sent on the wire during the epoch duration of
the Sphinx routing key. This of course has to take into account the size
of the Sphinx packets as well as the maximum line speed of the network
interface. This is a conservative tuning heuristic given that there must
be more than this maximum number of Sphinx packets in order for there to
be duplicate packets.</p>
<p>Our bloomfilter with hashmap replay detection cache looks like
this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="diagrams/replay1.png" alt="replay cache" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">replay cache</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that this diagram does NOT express the full complexity of the
replay caching system. In particular it does not describe how entries
are entered into the bloom filter and hashmap. Upon either bloom filter
mismatch or hashmap mismatch both data structures must be locked and the
replay tag inserted into each.</p>
<p>For the disk persistence mode of operation the hashmap can simply be
replaced with an efficient key value store. Persistent stores may use a
write back cache and other techniques for efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="epoch-boundaries">4.3 Epoch Boundaries</h2>
<p>Since mixes publish future epoch keys (see <a
href="#KATZMIXPKI">KATZMIXPKI</a>) so that Sphinx packets flowing
through the network can seamlessly straddle the epoch boundaries, our
replay detection forms a special kind of double bloom filter system.
During the epoch grace period mixes perform trial decryption of Sphinx
packets. The replay cache used will be the one that is associated with
the Sphinx routing key which was successfully used to decrypt (unwrap
transform) the Sphinx packet. This is not a double bloom filter in the
normal sense of this term since each bloom filter used is distinct and
associated with it’s own cache, furthermore, replay tags are only ever
inserted into one cache and one bloom filter.</p>
<h2 id="cost-of-checking-replays">4.4 Cost Of Checking Replays</h2>
<p>The cost of checking a replay tag from a single replay cache is the
sum of the following operations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sphinx packet unwrap operation</li>
<li>A bloom filter lookup</li>
<li>A hashmap or cache lookup</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore these operations are roughly O(1) in complexity. However
Sphinx packets processed near epoch boundaries will not be constant time
due to trial decryption with two Sphinx routing keys as mentioned above
in section “3.3 Epoch Boundaries”.</p>
<h1 id="concurrent-processing-of-sphinx-packet-replay-tags">5.
Concurrent Processing of Sphinx Packet Replay Tags</h1>
<p>The best way to implement a software based router is with a <a
href="#SEDA">SEDA</a> computational pipeline. We therefore need a
mechanism to allow multiple threads to reference our rotating Sphinx
keys and associated replay caches. Here we shall describe a shadow
memory system which the mix server uses such that the individual worker
threads shall always have a reference to the current set of candidate
mix keys and associates replay caches.</p>
<h2 id="pki-updates">5.1 PKI Updates</h2>
<p>The mix server periodically updates it’s knowledge of the network by
downloading a new consensus document as described in <a
href="#KATZMIXPKI">KATZMIXPKI</a>. The individual threads in the
“cryptoworker” thread pool which process Sphinx packets make use of a
<code>MixKey</code> data structure which consists of:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sphinx routing key material (public and private X25519 keys)</li>
<li>Replay Cache</li>
<li>Reference Counter</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these “cryptoworker” thread pool has it’s own hashmap
associating epochs to a reference to the <code>MixKey</code>. The mix
server PKI threat maintains a single hashmap which associates the epochs
with the corresponding <code>MixKey</code>. We shall refer to this
hashmap as <code>MixKeys</code>. After a new <code>MixKey</code> is
added to <code>MixKeys</code>, a “reshadow” operation is performed for
each “cryptoworker” thread. The “reshadow” operation performs two
tasks:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Removes entries from each “cryptoworker” thread's hashmap that are
no longer present in <code>MixKeys</code> and decrements the
<code>MixKey</code> reference counter.</li>
<li>Adds entries present in <code>MixKeys</code> but are not present in
the thread’s hashmap and increments the <code>MixKey</code> reference
counter.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once a given <code>MixKey</code> reference counter is decremented to
zero, the <code>MixKey</code> and it’s associated on disk data is
purged. Note that we do not discuss synchronization primitives, however
it should be obvious that updating the replay cache should likely make
use of a mutex or similar primitive to avoid data races between
“cryptoworker” threads.</p>
