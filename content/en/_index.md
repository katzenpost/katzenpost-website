{{% blocks/feature icon="fa fa-file-powerpoint" title="Katzenpost Threat Model" url="/research/Threat_Model_Doc.pdf" %}}
Here we present a draft of the Katzenpost mixnet threat model document.
We regard the threat model document as a living document which is frequently
edited and in need of ongoing maintenance as we continue to develop newer
mixnet protocols.

This doc, in particular, does not talk about the Katzenpost design. It does introduce the reader to some of the reasons why we've been making certain design decisions, and a keen eye might be led to some of the similar conclusions. But here we focus on already published research. We also stick to theory and don't focus on any practical systems being built today.
