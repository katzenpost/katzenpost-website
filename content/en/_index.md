Katzenpost is a free software project. We write mix network protocol
libraries. What is a mix network? It is an anonymous communications
system… however the word anonymous is problematic because some
government authorities equate anonymity with terrorism. We prefer to
instead call it “network security” because you can feel more secure
when you communicate using traffic analysis resistant communications
protocols.
