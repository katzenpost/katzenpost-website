<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>In the context of continuous time mixing stategies such as the
memoryless mix used by Katzenpost, n-1 attacks may use strategic
packetloss. Nodes can also fail for benign reasons. Determining whether
or not it’s an n-1 attack is outside the scope of this work.</p>
<p>This document describes how we will communicate statistics from mix
nodes to mix network directory authorities which tells them about the
packetloss they are observing.</p>
<h1 id="design-overview">1. Design Overview</h1>
<p>Nodes (mixes, gateways, and providers) need upload packet-loss
statistics to the directory authorities, so that authorities can label
malfunctioning nodes as such in the consensus in the next epoch.</p>
<p>Nodes currently sign and upload a Descriptor in each epoch.</p>
<p>In the future, they would instead upload a “UploadDescStats”
containing: * Descriptor * Stats * Signature</p>
<p>Stats contains: * a map from pairs-of-mixes to the ratio of
count-of-loops-sent vs count-of-loops-received</p>

deocy loop traffic design discussion</strong></p>
<h2 id="terminology">1.3 Terminology</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>wire protocol</code> - refers to our PQ Noise based
protocol which currently uses TCP but in the near future will optionally
use QUIC. This protocol has messages known as wire protocol
<code>commands</code>, which are used for various mixnet functions such
as sending or retrieving a message, dirauth voting etc. For more
information, please see our design doc: <a
href="https://github.com/katzenpost/katzenpost/blob/main/docs/specs/wire-protocol.md">wire
protocol specification</a></p></li>
<li><p><code>Providers</code> - refers to a set of node on the edge of
the network which have two roles, handle incoming client connections and
run mixnet services. Soon we should get rid of <code>Providers</code>
and replace it with two different sets, <code>gateway nodes</code> and
<code>service nodes</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Epoch</code> - The Katzenpost epoch is currently set to a
20 minute duration. Each new epoch there is a new PKI document published
containing public key material that will only be valid for that
epoch.</p></li>

<h1 id="tracking-packet-loss-and-detecting-faulty-mixes">2. Tracking
Packet Loss and Detecting Faulty Mixes</h1>
<p>Katzenpost lets different elements in the network track whether other
elements are functioning correctly. A node A will do this by sending
packets in randomly generated loops through the network, and tracking
whether the loop comes back or not. When it comes back, it will mark
that as evidence, that the nodes on the path of that loop are
functioning correctly.</p>
<p>Experimental setup, node A:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data: each network node <code>A</code> collects a record of emitted
test loops in a certain epoch, their paths and whether they returned or
not. Importantly, each loop is the same length and includes l
steps.</li>
<li>A segment is defined as a possible connection from a device in the
network to another, for example from a node in the layer <code>k</code>
to a node in the layer <code>k+1</code>. Each loop is a sequence of such
segments.</li>
<li>Each node <code>A</code> will create 3 hashmaps,
<code>sent_loops_A</code>, <code>completed_loops_A</code> and
<code>ratios_A</code>. Each of these will use a pair of concatenated
mixnode ID’s as the key. The ordering of the ID’s will be from lesser
topology layer to greater, e.g. the two-tuple (n, n+1) which is
represented here as a 64 byte array:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>var sent_loops_A map[[64]byte]int
var completed_loops_A map[[64]byte]int
var ratios_A map[[64]byte]float64</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Every time the node A sends out a test loop, for each segment in the
loop path, it will increment the value in
<code>sent_loops_A</code>.</li>
<li>When a test loop returns, for each step in the loop path, it will
increment the value in <code>completed_loops_A</code>.</li>
<li>Generate a new map entry in <code>ratios_A</code> for each
mix-node-pair <code>p</code>, if <code>sent_loops_A[p]==0</code> set
<code>ratios_A[p]=1</code>. Else
<code>ratios_A[p] = completed_loops_A[p]/sent_loops_A[p]</code></li>
<li>Plot the resulting distribution, and calculate the standard
deviation to detect anomalies. Have the node report significant
anomalies after a sufficient time period as to not leak information on
the route of individual loops.</li>
<li>Anomalies may have to be discarded if the corresponding
<code>sent_loops_A[p]</code> is small.</li>
</ul>
<p>You would expect the distribution of values in
<code>completed_loops</code> to approximate a binomial distribution. In
an absence of faulty nodes, <code>ratios</code> should be 1, and when
there are some faulty nodes values at faulty nodes should approach 0 (if
the node doesn’t work at all), and be binomially distributed at nodes
that can share a loop with faulty nodes.</p>
<p>Therefore each mix node generates a statistics report to upload to
the dirauth nodes, of the struct type:</p>
<pre><code>type LoopStats struct {
    Epoch           uint64
    MixIdentityHash *[32]byte
    Ratios          map[[64]byte]float64
}</code></pre>
<p>The report is subsequently uploaded to the directory authorities,
which combine the reports of individual nodes into a health status of
the network and arrive at a consensus decision about the topology of the
network.</p>
<h1 id="uploading-stats-to-dirauths">3. Uploading Stats to Dirauths</h1>
<p>Stats reports are uploaded along with the mix descriptor every Epoch.
A cryptographic signature covers both of these fields:</p>
<pre><code>type UploadDescStats struct {
         Descriptor []byte
         StatsReport []byte
         Signature []byte
 }</code></pre>
<p>Statistics reports collected during the XXX period of time, that is,
the time between descriptor N+1 upload and descriptor N+2 upload, are
what will affect the topology choices in epoch N+2 if the dirauths
collectively decide to act on the very latest statistics reports in
order to determine for example if a mix node should be removed from the
network:</p>
<pre><code>| ---------------- epoch N ---------------- | ---------------- epoch N+1 ---------------- | ---------------- epoch N+2 ---------------- |
| ----------- UD_N+1 ---------------------- | ------------ UD N+2 ----------------------- | ----------- UD N+3 ------------------------ |
         | ------------------ XXX ---------------- |</code></pre>
