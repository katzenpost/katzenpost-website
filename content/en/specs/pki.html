<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>Mixnets are designed with the assumption that a Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI) exists and it gives each client the same view of
the network. This specification is inspired by the Tor and Mixminion
Directory Authority systems <a
href="#MIXMINIONDIRAUTH">MIXMINIONDIRAUTH</a> <a
href="#TORDIRAUTH">TORDIRAUTH</a> whose main features are precisely what
we need for our PKI. These are decentralized systems meant to be
collectively operated by multiple entities.</p>
<p>The mix network directory authority system (PKI) is essentially a
cooperative decentralized database and voting system that is used to
produce network consensus documents which mix clients periodically
retrieve and use for their path selection algorithm when creating Sphinx
packets. These network consensus documents are derived from a voting
process between the Directory Authority servers.</p>
<p>This design prevents mix clients from using only a partial view of
the network for their path selection so as to avoid fingerprinting and
bridging attacks <a href="#FINGERPRINTING">FINGERPRINTING</a>, <a
href="#BRIDGING">BRIDGING</a>, and <a
href="#LOCALVIEW">LOCALVIEW</a>.</p>
<p>The PKI is also used by Authority operators to specify network-wide
parameters, for example in the Katzenpost Decryption Mix Network <a
href="#KATZMIXNET">KATZMIXNET</a> the Poisson mix strategy is used and,
therefore, all clients must use the same lambda parameter for their
exponential distribution function when choosing hop delays in the path
selection. The Mix Network Directory Authority system, aka PKI, SHALL be
used to distribute such network-wide parameters in the network consensus
document that have an impact on security and performance.</p>
<h2 id="conventions-used-in-this-document">1.1 Conventions Used in This
Document</h2>
<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <a
href="#RFC2119">RFC2119</a>.</p>
<p>The “C” style Presentation Language as described in <a
href="#RFC5246">RFC5246</a> Section 4 is used to represent data
structures for additional cryptographic wire protocol commands. <a
href="#KATZMIXWIRE">KATZMIXWIRE</a></p>
<h2 id="terminology">1.2 Terminology</h2>
<p><code>PKI</code> - Public Key Infrastructure</p>
<p><code>Directory Authority system</code> - refers to specific PKI
schemes used by</p>
<p>Mixminion and Tor</p>
<p><code>MSL</code> - maximum segment lifetime</p>
<p><code>mix descriptor</code> - A database record which describes a
component mix</p>
<p><code>family</code> - Identifier of security domains or entities
operating one or more mixes in the network. This is used to inform the
path selection algorithm.</p>
<p><code>nickname</code> - simply a nickname string that is unique in
the consensus document, see “Katzenpost Mix Network Specification”
section “2.2. Network Topology”.</p>
<p><code>layer</code> - The layer indicates which network topology layer
a particular mix resides in.</p>
<p><code>Provider</code> - A service operated by a third party that
Clients communicate directly with to communicate with the Mixnet. It is
responsible for Client authentication, forwarding outgoing messages to
the Mixnet, and storing incoming messages for the Client. The Provider
MUST have the ability to perform cryptographic operations on the relayed
messages.</p>
<h2 id="security-properties-overview">1.3 Security Properties
Overview</h2>
<p>This Directory Authority system has the following feature goals and
security properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>All Directory Authority servers must agree with each other on the
set of Directory Authorities.</li>
<li>All Directory Authority servers must agree with each other on the
set of mixes.</li>
<li>This system is intentionally designed to provide identical network
consensus documents to each mix client. This mitigates epistemic attacks
against the client path selection algorithm such as fingerprinting and
bridge attacks <a href="#FINGERPRINTING">FINGERPRINTING</a> <a
href="#BRIDGING">BRIDGING</a>.</li>
<li>This system is NOT byzantine-fault-tolerant, it instead allows for
manual intervention upon consensus fault by the Directory Authority
operators. Further, these operators are responsible for expelling bad
acting operators from the system.</li>
<li>This system enforces the network policies such as mix join policy
wherein intentionally closed mixnets will prevent arbitrary hosts from
joining the network by authenticating all descriptor signatures with a
list of allowed public keys.</li>
<li>The Directory Authority system for a given mix network is
essentially the root of all authority.</li>
</ul>
<h1
id="differences-from-tor-and-mixminion-directory-authority-systems">1.4
Differences from Tor and Mixminion Directory Authority systems</h1>
<p>In this document we specify a Directory Authority system which is
different from that of Tor's and Mixminion’s in a number of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The list of valid mixes is expressed in an allowlist. For the time
being there is no specified “bandwidth authority” system which verifies
the health of mixes (Further research required in this area).</li>
<li>There’s no non-directory channel to inform clients that a node is
down, so it will end up being a lot of packet loss, since clients will
continue to include the missing node in their path selection until keys
published by the node expire and it falls out of the consensus.</li>
<li>The schema of the mix descriptors is different from that used in
Mixminion and Tor, including a change which allows our mix descriptor to
express <em>n</em> Sphinx mix routing public keys in a single mix
descriptor whereas in the Tor and Mixminion Directory Authority systems,
<em>n</em> descriptors are used.</li>
<li>The serialization format of mix descriptors is different from that
used in Mixminion and Tor.</li>
<li>The shared random number computation is performed every voting
round, and is required for a vote to be accepted by each authority. The
shared random number is used to deterministically generate the network
topology.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="overview-of-mix-pki-interaction">2. Overview of Mix PKI
Interaction</h1>
<p>Each Mix MUST rotate the key pair used for Sphinx packet processing
periodically for forward secrecy reasons and to keep the list of seen
packet tags short. <a href="#SPHINX09">SPHINX09</a> <a
href="#SPHINXSPEC">SPHINXSPEC</a> The Katzenpost Mix Network uses a
fixed interval (<code>epoch</code>), so that key rotations happen
simultaneously throughout the network, at predictable times.</p>
<p>Each Directory Authority server MUST use some time synchronization
protocol in order to correctly use this protocol. This Directory
Authority system requires time synchronization to within a few
minutes.</p>
<p>Let each epoch be exactly <code>1200 seconds (20 minutes)</code> in
duration, and the 0th Epoch begin at
<code>2017-06-01 00:00 UTC</code>.</p>
<p>To facilitate smooth operation of the network and to allow for delays
that span across epoch boundaries, Mixes MUST publish keys to the PKI
for at least 3 epochs in advance, unless the mix will be otherwise
unavailable in the near future due to planned downtime.</p>
<p>At an epoch boundary, messages encrypted to keys from the previous
epoch are accepted for a grace period of 2 minutes.</p>
<p>Thus, at any time, keys for all Mixes for the Nth through N + 2nd
epoch will be available, allowing for a maximum round trip (forward
message + SURB) delay + transit time of 40 minutes. SURB lifetime is
limited to a single epoch because of the key rotation epoch, however
this shouldn’t present any useability problems since SURBs are only used
for sending ACK messages from the destination Provider to the sender as
described in <a href="#KATZMIXE2E">KATZMIXE2E</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pki-protocol-schedule">2.1 PKI Protocol Schedule</h2>
<p>There are two main constraints to Authority schedule:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There MUST be enough key material extending into the future so
that clients are able to construct Sphinx packets with a forward and
reply paths.</p></li>
<li><p>All participants should have enough time to participate in the
protocol; upload descriptors, vote, generate documents, download
documents, establish connections for user traffic.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The epoch duration of 20 minutes is more than adequate for these two
constraints.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: perhaps we should make it shorter? but first let’s do some
scaling and bandwidth calculations to see how bad it gets…</em></p>
<h2 id="directory-authority-server-schedule">2.1.1 Directory Authority
Server Schedule</h2>
<p>Directory Authority server interactions are conducted according to
the following schedule, where <code>T</code> is the beginning of the
current epoch, and <code>P</code> is the length of the epoch period.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>T</code> - Epoch begins</li>
<li><code>T + P/2</code> - Vote exchange</li>
<li><code>T + (5/8)*P</code> - Reveal exchange</li>
<li><code>T + (6/8)*P</code> - Tabulation and signature exchange</li>
<li><code>T + (7/8)*P</code> - Publish consensus</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mix-schedule">2.1.2 Mix Schedule</h2>
<p>Mix PKI interactions are conducted according to the following
schedule, where T is the beginning of the current epoch.</p>
<p><code>T + P/8</code> - Deadline for publication of all mixes
documents for the next epoch.</p>
<p><code>T + (7/8)*P</code> - This marks the beginning of the period
where mixes perform staggered fetches of the PKI consensus document.</p>
<p><code>T + (8/9)*P</code> - Start establishing connections to the new
set of relevant mixes in advance of the next epoch.</p>
<p><code>T + P - 1MSL</code> - Start accepting new Sphinx packets
encrypted to the next epoch’s keys.</p>
<p><code>T + P + 1MSL</code> - Stop accepting new Sphinx packets
encrypted to the previous epoch’s keys, close connections to peers no
longer listed in the PKI documents and erase the list of seen packet
tags.</p>
<p>Mix layer changes are controlled by the Directory Authorities and
therefore a mix can be reassigned to a different layer in our stratified
topology at any new epoch. Mixes will maintain incoming and outgoing
connections to the various nodes until all mix keys have expired, iff
the node is still listed anywhere in the current document.</p>
<h1 id="voting-for-consensus-protocol">3. Voting for Consensus
Protocol</h1>
<p>In our Directory Authority protocol, all the actors conduct their
behavior according to a common schedule as outlined in section "2.1 PKI
Protocol Schedule". The Directory Authority servers exchange messages to
reach consensus about the network. Other tasks they perform include
collecting mix descriptor uploads from each mix for each key rotation
epoch, voting, shared random number generation, signature exchange and
publishing of the network consensus documents.</p>
<h2 id="protocol-messages">3.1 Protocol Messages</h2>
<p>There are only two document types in this protocol:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mix_descriptor</code>: A mix descriptor describes a mix.</li>
<li><code>directory</code>: A directory contains a list of descriptors
and other information that describe the mix network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix descriptor and directory documents MUST be properly signed.</p>
<h2 id="mix-descriptor-and-directory-signing">3.1.1 Mix Descriptor and
Directory Signing</h2>
<p>Mixes MUST compose mix descriptors which are signed using their
private identity key, an ed25519 key. Directories are signed by one or
more Directory Authority servers using their authority key, also an
ed25519 key. In all cases, signing is done using JWS <a
href="#RFC7515">RFC7515</a>.</p>
<h2 id="vote-exchange">3.2 Vote Exchange</h2>
<p>As described in section “2.1 PKI Protocol Schedule”, the Directory
Authority servers begin the voting process 1/8 of an epoch period after
the start of a new epoch. Each Authority exchanges vote directory
messages with each other.</p>
<p>Authorities archive votes from other authorities and make them
available for retreival. Upon receiving a new vote, the authority
examines it for new descriptors and includes any valid descriptors in
its view of the network.</p>
<p>Each Authority includes in its vote a hashed value committing to a
choice of a random number for the vote. See section 4.3 for more
details.</p>
<p><strong>3.2.1 Voting Wire Protocol Commands</strong></p>
<p>The Katzenpost Wire Protocol as described in <code>KATZMIXWIRE</code>
is used by Authorities to exchange votes. We define additional wire
protocol commands for sending votes:</p>
<pre><code>enum {

:   vote(22), vote_status(23),

} Command;</code></pre>
<p>The structures of these commands are defined as follows:</p>
<pre><code>struct {
:   uint64_t epoch_number; opaque public_key[ED25519_KEY_LENGTH];
    opaque payload[];

} VoteCommand;

struct {
:   uint8 error_code;

} VoteStatusCommand;</code></pre>
<p><strong>3.2.2 The vote Command</strong></p>
<p>The vote command is used to send a PKI document to a peer Authority
during the voting period of the PKI schedule.</p>
<p>The payload field contains the signed and serialized PKI document
representing the sending Authority’s vote. The public_key field contains
the public identity key of the sending Authority which the receiving
Authority can use to verify the signature of the payload. The
epoch_number field is used by the receiving party to quickly check the
epoch for the vote before deserializing the payload.</p>
<p>Each authority MUST include its commit value for the shared random
computation in this phase along with its signed vote. This computation
is derived from the Tor Shared Random Subsystem, <a
href="#TORSRV">TORSRV</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3.2.3 The vote_status Command</strong></p>
<p>The vote_status command is used to reply to a vote command. The
error_code field indicates if there was a failure in the receiving of
the PKI document.</p>
<pre><code>enum {

:   vote_ok(0), /\* None error condition. */ vote_too_early(1), /*
    The Authority should try again later. */ vote_too_late(2), /*
    This round of voting was missed. \*/
}</code></pre>
<p>The epoch_number field of the vote struct is compared with the epoch
that is currently being voted on. vote_too_early and vote_too_late are
replied back to the voter to report that their vote was not
accepted.</p>
<h2 id="reveal-exchange">3.3 Reveal Exchange</h2>
<p>As described in section “2.1 PKI Protocol Schedule”, the Directory
Authority servers exchange the reveal values after they have exchanged
votes which contain a commit value. Each Authority exchanges reveal
messages with each other.</p>
<p>3.3.1 Reveal Wire Protocol Commands</p>
<p>The Katzenpost Wire Protocol as described in <a
href="#KATZMIXWIRE">KATZMIXWIRE</a> is used by Authorities to exchange
reveal values previously commited to in their votes. We define
additional wire protocol commands for exchanging reveals:</p>
<pre><code>enum {
:   reveal(25), reveal_status(26),
} Command;</code></pre>
<p>The structures of these commands are defined as follows:</p>
<pre><code>struct {
:   uint64_t epoch_number; opaque public_key[ED25519_KEY_LENGTH];
    opaque payload[];

} RevealCommand;

struct {
:   uint8 error_code;

} RevealStatusCommand;</code></pre>
<p><strong>3.3.2 The reveal Command</strong></p>
<p>The reveal command is used to send a reveal value to a peer authority
during the reveal period of the PKI schedule.</p>
<p>The payload field contains the signed and serialized reveal value.
The public_key field contains the public identity key of the sending
Authority which the receiving Authority can use to verify the signature
of the payload. The epoch_number field is used by the receiving party to
quickly check the epoch for the reveal before deserializing the
payload.</p>
<p><strong>3.3.3 The reveal_status Command</strong></p>
<p>The reveal_status command is used to reply to a reveal command. The
error_code field indicates if there was a failure in the receiving of
the shared random reveal value.</p>
<pre><code>enum {

:   reveal_ok(8), /* None error condition. */ reveal_too_early(9), 
    /* The Authority should try again later. */
    reveal_not_authorized(10), /* The Authority was rejected. */
    reveal_already_received(11), /* The Authority has already revealed
    this round. */ reveal_too_late(12) /* This round of revealing was
    missed. */

} Errorcodes;</code></pre>
<p>The epoch_number field of the reveal struct is compared with the
epoch that is currently being voted on. reveal_too_early and
reveal_too_late are replied back to the authority to report their reveal
was not accepted. The status code reveal_not_authorized is used if the
Authority is rejected. The reveal_already_received is used to report
that a valid reveal command was already received for this round.</p>
<h2 id="cert-exchange">3.4 Cert Exchange</h2>
<p>The Cert command is the same as a Vote but contains the set of Reveal
values as seen by the voting peer. In order to ensure that a
misconfigured or malicious Authority operator cannot amplify their
ability to influence the threshold voting process, after Reveal messages
have been exchanged, Authorities vote again, including the Reveals seen
by them. Authorities may not introduce new MixDescriptors at this phase
in the protocol.</p>
<p>Otherwise, a consensus partition can be obtained by witholding Reveal
values from a threshold number of Peers. In the case of an even-number
of Authorities, a denial of service by a single Authority was
observed.</p>
<h2 id="vote-tabulation-for-consensus-computation">3.5 Vote Tabulation
for Consensus Computation</h2>
<p>The main design constraint of the vote tabulation algorithm is that
it MUST be a deterministic process that produces the same result for
each directory authority server. This result is known as a network
consensus file.</p>
<p>A network consensus file is a well formed directory struct where the
<code>status</code> field is set to <code>consensus</code> and contains
0 or more descriptors, the mix directory is signed by 0 or more
directory authority servers. If signed by the full voting group then
this is called a fully signed consensus.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Validate each vote directory:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>that the liveness fields correspond to the following epoch</li>
<li>status is <code>vote</code></li>
<li>version number matches ours</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Compute a consensus directory:</li>
</ol>
<p>Here we include a modified section from the Mixminion PKI spec <a
href="#MIXMINIONDIRAUTH">MIXMINIONDIRAUTH</a>:</p>
<p>For each distinct mix identity in any vote directory:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If there are multiple nicknames for a given identity, do not
include any descriptors for that identity.</p></li>
<li><p>If half or fewer of the votes include the identity, do not
include any descriptors for the identity. <em>This also guarantees that
there will be only one identity per nickname.</em></p></li>
<li><p>If we are including the identity, then for each distinct
descriptor that appears in any vote directory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not include the descriptor if it will have expired on the date
the directory will be published.</li>
<li>Do not include the descriptor if it is superseded by other
descriptors for this identity.</li>
<li>Do not include the descriptor if it not valid in the next
epoch.</li>
<li>Otherwise, include the descriptor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Sort the list of descriptors by the signature field so that
creation of the consensus is reproducible.</p></li>
<li><p>Set directory <code>status</code> field to
<code>consensus</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Compute a shared random number from the values revealed in the
“Reveal” step. Authorities whose reveal value does not verify their
commit value MUST be excluded from the consensus round. Authorities
ensure that their peers MUST participate in Commit-and-Reveal, and MUST
use correct Reveal values obtained from other Peers as part of the
“Cert” exchange.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate or update the network topology using the shared random
number as a seed to a deterministic random number generator that
determines the order that new mixes are placed into the
topology.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="signature-collection">3.6 Signature Collection</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Each Authority signs their view of consensus, and exchanges detached
Signatures with each other. Upon receiving each Signature it is added to
the signatures on the Consensus if it validates the Consensus. The
Authority SHOULD warn the administrator if network partition is
detected.</p>
<p>If there is disagreement about the consensus directory, each
authority collects signatures from only the servers which it agrees with
about the final consensus.</p>

which is what the Sphinx packet format uses.</p>

<h2 id="pki-wire-protocol">5. PKI Wire Protocol</h2>
<p>The Katzenpost Wire Protocol as described in <a

Directory Authority peers. In the following section we describe
additional wire protocol commands for publishing mix descriptors, voting
and consensus retrieval.</p>
<h3 id="mix-descriptor-publication">5.1 Mix Descriptor publication</h3>
<p>The following commands are used for publishing mix descriptors and
setting mix descriptor status:</p>
<pre><code>enum {

<p>The post_descriptor_status command is sent in response to a
post_descriptor command, and uses the following error codes:</p>
<pre><code>enum {
   descriptor_ok(0),
   descriptor_invalid(1),
   descriptor_conflict(2),
   descriptor_forbidden(3),
} ErrorCodes;</code></pre>
<h2 id="voting">5.2 Voting</h2>
<p>The following commands are used by Authorities to exchange votes:</p>
<pre><code>enum {

    opaque payload[];
} VoteCommand;

struct {

<h3 id="the-vote-command">5.2.1 The vote Command</h3>
<p>The <code>vote</code> command is used to send a PKI document to a
peer Authority during the voting period of the PKI schedule.</p>
<p>The payload field contains the signed and serialized PKI document
representing the sending Authority’s vote. The public_key field contains
the public identity key of the sending Authority which the receiving

accepted.</p>
<h3 id="the-get_vote-command">5.2.3 The get_vote Command</h3>
<p>The <code>get_vote</code> command is used to request a PKI document
(vote) from a peer Authority. The epoch field contains the epoch from
which to request the vote, and the public_key field contains the public
identity key of the Authority of the requested vote. A successful query
is responded to with a vote command, and queries that fail are responded
to with a vote_status command with error_code vote_not_found(7).</p>
<h3 id="retrieval-of-consensus">5.3 Retrieval of Consensus</h3>
<p>Providers in the Katzenpost mix network system <a
href="#KATZMIXNET">KATZMIXNET</a> may cache validated network consensus
files and serve them to clients over the mix network's link layer wire
protocol <a href="#KATZMIXWIRE">KATZMIXWIRE</a>. We define additional
wire protocol commands for requesting and sending PKI consensus
documents:</p>
<pre><code>enum {
   /* Extending the wire protocol Commands. */
   get_consensus(18),
   consensus(19),
} Command;

The structures of these commands are defined as follows:</code></pre>
<pre><code>struct {
    uint64_t epoch_number;
} GetConsensusCommand;

struct {
   uint8 error_code;
   opaque payload[];
} ConsensusCommand;</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-get_consensus-command">5.3.1 The get_consensus Command</h3>
<p>The get_consensus command is a command that is used to retrieve a
recent consensus document. If a given get_consensus command contains an
Epoch value that is either too big or too small then a reply consensus
command is sent with an empty payload. Otherwise if the consensus
request is valid then a consensus command containing a recent consensus
document is sent in reply.</p>
<p>Initiators MUST terminate the session immediately upon reception of a
get_consensus command.</p>
<h3 id="the-consensus-command">5.3.2 The consensus Command</h3>
<p>The consensus command is a command that is used to send a recent
consensus document. The error_code field indicates if there was a
failure in retrieval of the PKI consensus document.</p>
<pre><code>enum {
   consensus_ok(0),        /* None error condition and SHOULD be accompanied with
                              a valid consensus payload. */
   consensus_not_found(1), /* The client should try again later. */
   consensus_gone(2),      /* The consensus will not be available in the future. */
} ErrorCodes;</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-cert-command">5.4.1 The Cert Command</h3>
<p>The <code>cert</code> command is used to send a PKI document to a
peer Authority during the voting period of the PKI schedule. It is the
same as the <code>vote</code> command, but must contain the set of
SharedRandomCommit and SharedRandomReveal values as seen by the
Authority during the voting process.</p>
<h3 id="the-certstatus-command">5.4.2 The CertStatus Command</h3>
<p>The <code>cert_status</code> command is the response to a
<code>cert</code> command, and is the same as a <code>vote_status</code>
response, other than the command identifier. Responses are CertOK,
CertTooEarly, CertNotAuthorized, CertNotSigned, CertAlreadyReceived,
CertTooLate</p>
<h3 id="signature-exchange">5.5 Signature Exchange</h3>
<p>Signatures exchange is the final round of the consensus protocol and
consists of the Sig and SigStatus commands.</p>
<h3 id="the-sig-command">5.5.1 The Sig Command</h3>
<p>The <code>sig</code> command contains a detached Signature from
PublicKey of Consensus for Epoch.</p>
<h3 id="the-sigstatus-command">5.5.2 The SigStatus Command</h3>
<p>The <code>sig_status</code> command is the response to a
<code>sig</code> command. Responses are SigOK, SigNotAuthorized,
SigNotSigned, SigTooEarly, SigTooLate, SigAlreadyReceived, and
SigInvalid.</p>
<h2 id="scalability-considerations">6. Scalability Considerations</h2>
<p><em>TODO: notes on scaling, bandwidth usage etc.</em></p>
<h2 id="future-work">7. Future Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>byzantine fault tolerance</li>
<li>PQ crypto signatures for all PKI documents: mix descriptors and
directories. <a href="#SPHINCS256">SPHINCS256</a> could be used, we
already have a golang implementation:
https://github.com/Yawning/sphincs256/</li>
<li>Make a Bandwidth Authority system to measure health of the network.
Also perform load balancing as described in <a
href="#PEERFLOW">PEERFLOW</a>?</li>
<li>Implement byzantine attack defenses as described in <a
href="#MIRANDA">MIRANDA</a> and <a href="#MIXRELIABLE">MIXRELIABLE</a>
where mix link performance proofs are recorded and used in a reputation
system.</li>
<li>Choose a different serialization/schema language?</li>
<li>Use a append only merkle tree instead of this voting protocol.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="anonymity-considerations">8. Anonymity Considerations</h1>
<ul>
<li>This system is intentionally designed to provide identical network
consensus documents to each mix client. This mitigates epistemic attacks
against the client path selection algorithm such as fingerprinting and
bridge attacks <a href="#FINGERPRINTING">FINGERPRINTING</a>, <a
href="#BRIDGING">BRIDGING</a>.</li>
<li>If consensus has failed and thus there is more than one consensus
file, clients MUST NOT use this compromised consensus and refuse to
run.</li>
<li>We try to avoid randomizing the topology because doing so splits the
anonymity sets on each mix into two. That is, packets belonging to the
previous topology versus the current topology are trivially
distinguishable. On the other hand if enough mixes fall out of consensus
eventually the mixnet will need to be rebalanced to avoid an attacker
compromised path selection. One example of this would be the case where
the adversary controls the only mix is one layer of the network
topology.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="security-considerations">9. Security Considerations</h1>
<ul>
<li>The Directory Authority / PKI system for a given mix network is
essentially the root of all authority in the system. The PKI controls
the contents of the network consensus documents that mix clients
download and use to inform their path selection. Therefore if the PKI as
a whole becomes compromised then so will the rest of the system in terms
of providing the main security properties described as traffic analysis
resistance. Therefore a decentralized voting protocol is used so that
the system is more resiliant when attacked, in accordance with the
principle of least authority. <a href="#SECNOTSEP"
class="citation">SECNOTSEP</a></li>
<li>Short epoch durations make it is more practical to make corrections
to network state using the PKI voting rounds.</li>
<li>Fewer epoch keys published in advance is a more conservative
security policy because it implies reduced exposure to key compromise
attacks.</li>
<li>A bad acting Directory Authority who lies on each vote and votes
inconsistently can trivially cause a denial of service for each voting
round.</li>
