<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>This document describes the high level architecture and detailed
protocols and behavior required of mix nodes participating in the
Katzenpost Mix Network.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>This specification provides the design of a mix network meant provide
an anonymous messaging protocol between clients and public mixnet
services.</p>
<p>Various system components such as client software, end to end
messaging protocols, Sphinx cryptographic packet format and wire
protocol are described in their own specification documents.</p>
<h2 id="terminology">1.1 Terminology</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>A <code>KiB</code> is defined as 1024 8 bit octets.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Mixnet</code> - A mixnet also known as a mix network is a
network of mixes that can be used to build various privacy preserving
protocols.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Mix</code> - A cryptographic router that is used to compose
a mixnet. Mixes use a cryptographic operation on messages being routed
which provides bitwise unlinkability with respect to input versus output
messages. Katzenpost is a decryption mixnet that uses the Sphinx
cryptographic packet format.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Node</code> - A Mix. Client's are NOT considered nodes in
the mix network. However note that network protocols are often layered;
in our design documents we describe "mixnet hidden services" which can
be operated by mixnet clients. Therefore if you are using node in some
adherence to methematical termonology one could conceivably designate a
client as a node. That having been said, it would not be appropriate to
the discussion of our core mixnet protocol to refer to the clients as
nodes.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Entry mix</code>, <code>Entry node</code> - An entry mix is
a mix that has some additional features:</p></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>An entry mix is always the first hop in routes where the message
originates from a client.</li>
<li>An entry mix authenticates client’s direct connections via the
mixnet’s wire protocol.</li>
<li>An entry mix queues reply messages and allows clients to retrieve
them later.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>Service mix</code> - A service mix is a mix that has some
additional features:</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>A service mix is always the last hop in routes where the message
originates from a client.</li>
<li>A service mix runs mixnet services which use a Sphinx SURB based
protocol.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p><code>User</code> - An agent using the Katzenpost
system.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Client</code> - Software run by the User on its local
device to participate in the Mixnet. Again let us reiterate that a
client is not considered a "node in the network" at the level of
analysis where we are discussing the core mixnet protocol in this here
document.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Katzenpost</code> - A project to design many improved
decryption mixnet protocols.</p>
<p>Classes of traffic - We distinguish the following classes of
traffic:</p></li>
<li><p>SURB Replies (also sometimes referred to as ACKs)</p></li>
<li><p>Forward messages</p></li>
<li><p><code>Packet</code> - Also known as a Sphinx packet. A nested
encrypted packet that, is routed through the mixnet and
cryptographically transformed at each hop. The length of the packet is
fixed for every class of traffic. Packet payloads encapsulate
messages.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Payload</code> - The payload, also known as packet payload,
is a portion of a Packet containing a message, or part of a message, to
be delivered anonymously.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Message</code> - A variable-length sequence of octets sent
anonymously through the network. Short messages are sent in a single
packet; long messages are fragmented across multiple packets.</p></li>
<li><p><code>MSL</code> - Maximum Segment Lifetime, 120
seconds.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conventions-used-in-this-document">1.2 Conventions Used in This
Document</h2>
<p>The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <a
href="#RFC2119">RFC2119</a></p>
<h1 id="system-overview">2. System Overview</h1>
<p>The presented system design is based on <a href="#LOOPIX">LOOPIX</a>
Below, we present the system overview.</p>
<p>The entry mixes are responsible for authenticating clients, accepting
packets from the client, and forwarding them to the mix network, which
then relays packets to the destination service mix. Our network design
uses a strict topology where forward message traverse the network from
entry mix to service mix. Service mixes can optionally reply if the
forward message contained a Single Use Reply Block (see <a
href="#SPHINXSPEC">SPHINXSPEC</a>.</p>
<p>The PKI system that handles the distribution of various network wide
parameters, and information required for each participant to participate
in the network such as IP address/port combinations that each node can
be reached at, and cryptographic public keys. The specification for the
PKI is beyond the scope of this document and is instead covered in <a
href="#KATZMIXPKI">KATZMIXPKI</a>.</p>
<p>The mix network provides neither reliable nor in-order delivery
semantics. The described mix network is neither a user facing messaging
system nor is it an application. It is intended to be a low level
protocol which can be composed to form more elaborate mixnet protocols
with stronger more useful privacy notions.</p>
<h2 id="threat-model">2.1 Threat Model</h2>
<p>Here we cannot present the threat model to the higher level mixnet
protocols. However this low level core mixnet protocol does have it’s
own threat model which we attempt to illucidate here.</p>
<p>We assume that the clients only talk to mixnet services. These
services make use of a client provided delivery token known as a SURB
(Single Use Reply Block) to send their replies to the client without
knowing the client’s entry mix. This system guarantees third-party
anonymity, meaning that no parties other than client and the service are
able to learn that the client and service are communicating. Note that
this is in contrast with other designs, such as Mixminion, which provide
sender anonymity towards recipients as well as anonymous replies.</p>
<p>Mixnet clients will randomly select an entry node to use and may
reconnect if disconnected for under a duration threshold. The entry mix
can determine the approximate message volume originating from and
destined to a given client. We consider the entry mix follows the
protocol and might be an honest-but-curious adversary.</p>
<p>External local network observers can not determine the number of
Packets traversing their region of the network because of the use of
decoy traffic sent by the clients. Global observers will not be able to
de-anonymize packet paths if there are enough packets traversing the mix
network. Longer term statistical disclosure attacks are likely possible
in order to link senders and receivers.</p>
<p>A malicious mix only has the ability to remember which input packets
correspond to the output packets. To discover the entire path all of the
mixes in the path would have to be malicious. Moreover, the malicious
mixes can drop, inject, modify or delay the packets for more or less
time than specified.</p>
<h2 id="network-topology">2.2 Network Topology</h2>
<p>The Katzenpost Mix Network uses a layered topology consisting of a
fixed number of layers, each containing a set of mixes. At any given
time each Mix MUST only be assigned to one specific layer. Each Mix in a
given layer N is connected to every other Mix in the previous and next
layer, and or every participating Provider in the case of the mixes in
layer 0 or layer N (first and last layer). :</p>
<pre><code>Layer 0          Layer 1        Layer 2        Layer 3           Layer 4
+-----------+      +-------+      +-------+      +-------+      +-------------+
+-&gt; | entry mix | -+-&gt; |  Mix  | -+-&gt; |  Mix  | -+-&gt; |  Mix  | -+-&gt; | service mix |
|   +-----------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------------+
|                  |              |              |              |
|   +-----------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------------+
+-&gt; | entry mix | -+-&gt; |  Mix  | -+-&gt; |  Mix  | -+-&gt; |  Mix  | -+-&gt; | service mix |
|   +-----------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------------+
|                  |              |              |              |
|                  |   +-------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------+  |   +-------------+

|                      +-------+      +-------+      +-------+  |   +-------------+
|                                                               |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+</code></pre>
<p>Note: Multiple distinct connections are collapsed in the figure for
sake of brevity/clarity.</p>
<p>The network topology MUST also maximize the number of security
domains traversed by the packets. This can be achieved by not allowing
mixes from the same security domain to be in different layers.</p>
<p>Requirements for the topology:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should allow for non-uniform throughput of each mix (Get bandwidth
weights from the PKI).</li>
<li>Should maximize distribution among security domains, in this case
the mix descriptor specified family field would indicate the security
domain or entity operating the mix.</li>
<li>Other legal jurisdictional region awareness for increasing the cost
of compulsion attacks.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="packet-format-overview">3. Packet Format Overview</h1>
<p>For the packet format of the transported messages we use the Sphinx
cryptographic packet format. The detailed description of the packet
format, construction, processing and security / anonymity considerations
see <a href="#SPHINXSPEC">SPHINXSPEC</a>, “The Sphinx Mix Network
Cryptographic Packet Format Specification”.</p>
<p>As the Sphinx packet format is generic, the Katzenpost Mix Network
must provide a concrete instantiation of the format, as well as
additional Sphinx per-hop routing information commands.</p>
<h2 id="sphinx-cryptographic-primitives">3.1 Sphinx Cryptographic
Primitives</h2>
<p>For the current version of the Katzenpost Mix Network, let the
following cryptographic primitives be used as described in the Sphinx
specification.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>H(M)</code> - As the output of this primitive is only used
locally to a Mix, any suitable primitive may be used.</li>
<li><code>MAC(K, M)</code> - HMAC-SHA256 <a href="#RFC6234">RFC6234</a>,
M_KEY_LENGTH of 32 bytes (256 bits), and MAC_LENGTH of 32 bytes (256
bits).</li>
<li><code>KDF(SALT, IKM)</code> - HKDF-SHA256, HKDF-Expand only, with
SALT used as the info parameter.</li>
<li><code>S(K, IV)</code> - CTR-AES256 <a
href="#SP80038A">[SP80038A]</a>, S_KEY_LENGTH of 32 bytes (256 bits),
and S_IV_LENGTH of 12 bytes (96 bits), using a 32 bit counter.</li>
<li><code>SPRP_Encrypt(K, M)/SPRP_Decrypt(K, M)</code> - AEZv5 <a
href="#AEZV5">AEZV5</a>, SPRP_KEY_LENGTH of 48 bytes (384 bits). As
there is a disconnect between AEZv5 as specified and the Sphinx usage,
let the following be the AEZv5 parameters:
<ul>
<li>nonce - 16 bytes, reusing the per-hop Sphinx header IV.</li>
<li>additional_data - Unused.</li>
<li>tau - 0 bytes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>EXP(X, Y)</code> - X25519 <a href="#RFC7748">RFC7748</a>
scalar multiply, GROUP_ELEMENT_LENGTH of 32 bytes (256 bits), G is the
X25519 base point.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sphinx-packet-parameters">3.2 Sphinx Packet Parameters</h2>
<p>The following parameters are used as for the Katzenpost Mix Network
instantiation of the Sphinx Packet Format:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>AD_SIZE</code> - 2 bytes.</li>
<li><code>SECURITY_PARAMETER</code> - 32 bytes. (except for our SPRP
which we plan to upgrade)</li>
<li><code>PER_HOP_RI_SIZE</code> - (XXX/ya: Addition is hard, let's go
shopping.)</li>
<li><code>NODE_ID_SIZE</code> - 32 bytes, the size of the Ed25519 public
key, used as Node identifiers.</li>
<li><code>RECIPIENT_ID_SIZE</code> - 64 bytes, the maximum size of
local-part component in an e-mail address.</li>
<li><code>SURB_ID_SIZE</code> - Single Use Reply Block ID size, 16
bytes.</li>
<li><code>MAX_HOPS</code> - 5, the ingress provider, a set of three
mixes, and the egress provider.</li>
<li><code>PAYLOAD_SIZE</code> - (XXX/ya: Subtraction is hard, let's go
shopping.)</li>
<li><code>KDF_INFO</code> - The byte string
<code>Katzenpost-kdf-v0-hkdf-sha256</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sphinx Packet Header <code>additional_data</code> field is
specified as follows:</p>
<pre><code>struct {
    uint8_t version;  /* 0x00 */
    uint8_t reserved; /* 0x00 */
} KatzenpostAdditionalData;</code></pre>
<p>Double check to ensure that this causes the rest of the packet header
to be 4 byte aligned, when wrapped in the wire protocol command and
framing. This might need to have 3 bytes reserved instead.</p>
<p>All nodes MUST reject Sphinx Packets that have
<code>additional_data</code> that is not as specified in the header.</p>
<p>Design decision.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can eliminate a trial decryption step per packet around the epoch
transitions by having a command that rewrites the AD on a per-hop basis
and including an epoch identifier.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am uncertain as to if the additional complexity is worth it for a
situation that can happen for a few minutes out of every epoch.</p>
<h2 id="sphinx-per-hop-routing-information-extensions">3.3 Sphinx
Per-hop Routing Information Extensions</h2>
<p>The following extensions are added to the Sphinx Per-Hop Routing
Information commands.</p>
<p>Let the following additional routing commands be defined in the
extension RoutingCommandType range (<code>0x80</code> -
<code>0xff</code>):</p>
<pre><code>enum {
    mix_delay(0x80),
} KatzenpostCommandType;</code></pre>
<p>The mix_delay command structure is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>struct {
    uint32_t delay_ms;
} NodeDelayCommand;</code></pre>
<h1 id="mix-node-operation">4. Mix Node Operation</h1>
<p>All Mixes behave in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accept incoming connections from peers, and open persistent
connections to peers as needed
<code>Section 4.1 &lt;4.1&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Periodically interact with the PKI to publish Identity and Sphinx
packet public keys, and to obtain information about the peers it should
be communicating with, along with periodically rotating the Sphinx
packet keys for forward secrecy
<code>Section 4.2 &lt;4.2&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Process inbound Sphinx Packets, delay them for the specified time
and forward them to the appropriate Mix and or Provider
<code>Section 4.3 &lt;4.3&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>All Nodes are identified by their link protocol signing key, for the
purpose of the Sphinx packet source routing hop identifier.</p>
<p>All Nodes participating in the Mix Network MUST share a common view
of time, via NTP or similar time synchronization mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="link-layer-connection-management">4.1 Link Layer Connection
Management</h2>
<p>All communication to and from participants in the Katzenpost Mix
Network is done via the Katzenpost Mix Network Wire Protocol <a
href="#KATZMIXWIRE">KATZMIXWIRE</a>.</p>
<p>Nodes are responsible for establishing the connection to the next
hop, for example, a mix in layer 0 will accept inbound connections from
all Providers listed in the PKI, and will proactively establish
connections to each mix in layer 1.</p>
<p>Nodes MAY accept inbound connections from unknown Nodes, but MUST not
relay any traffic until they became known via listing in the PKI
document, and MUST terminate the connection immediately if
authentication fails for any other reason.</p>
<p>Nodes MUST impose an exponential backoff when reconnecting if a link
layer connection gets terminated, and the minimum retry interval MUST be
no shorter than 5 seconds.</p>
<p>Nodes MAY rate limit inbound connections as required to keep load and
or resource use at a manageable level, but MUST be prepared to handle at
least one persistent long lived connection per potentially eligible peer
at all times.</p>
<h2 id="sphinx-mix-and-provider-key-rotation">4.2 Sphinx Mix and
Provider Key Rotation</h2>
<p>Each Node MUST rotate the key pair used for Sphinx packet processing
periodically for forward secrecy reasons and to keep the list of seen
packet tags short. The Katzenpost Mix Network uses a fixed interval
(<code>epoch</code>), so that key rotations happen simultaneously
throughout the network, at predictable times.</p>
<p>Let each epoch be exactly <code>10800 seconds (3 hours)</code> in
duration, and the 0th Epoch begin at <code>2017-06-01 00:00 UTC</code>.
For more details see our “Katzenpost Mix Network Public Key
Infrastructure Specification” document. <a
href="#KATZMIXPKI">KATZMIXPKI</a></p>
<h2 id="sphinx-packet-processing">4.3 Sphinx Packet Processing</h2>
<p>The detailed processing of the Sphinx packet is described in the
Sphinx specification: “The Sphinx Mix Network Cryptographic Packet
Format Specification”. Below, we present an overview of the steps which
the node is performing upon receiving the packet:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Records the time of reception.</li>
<li>Perform a <code>Sphinx_Unwrap</code> operation to authenticate and
decrypt a packet, discarding it immediately if the operation fails.</li>
<li>Apply replay detection to the packet, discarding replayed packets
immediately.</li>
<li>Act on the routing commands.</li>
</ol>
<p>All packets processed by Mixes MUST contain the following
commands.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>NextNodeHopCommand</code>, specifying the next Mix or Provider
that the packet will be forwarded to.</li>
<li><code>NodeDelayCommand</code>, specifying the delay in milliseconds
to be applied to the packet, prior to forwarding it to the Node
specified by the NextNodeHopCommand, as measured from the time of
reception.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mixes MUST discard packets that have any commands other than a
<code>NextNodeHopCommand</code> or a <code>NodeDelayCommand</code>. Note
that this does not apply to Providers or Clients, which have additional
commands related to recipient and
<code>SURB (Single Use Reply Block)</code> processing.</p>
<p>Nodes MUST continue to accept the previous epoch’s key for up to 1MSL
past the epoch transition, to tolerate latency and clock skew, and MUST
start accepting the next epoch’s key 1MSL prior to the epoch transition
where it becomes the current active key.</p>
<p>Upon the final expiration of a key (1MSL past the epoch transition),
Nodes MUST securely destroy the private component of the expired Sphinx
packet processing key along with the backing store used to maintain
replay information associated with the expired key.</p>
<p>Nodes MAY discard packets at any time, for example to keep congestion
and or load at a manageable level, however assuming the
<code>Sphinx_Unwrap</code> operation was successful, the packet MUST be
fed into the replay detection mechanism.</p>
<p>Nodes MUST ensure that the time a packet is forwarded to the next
Node is around the time of reception plus the delay specified in
<code>NodeDelayCommand</code>. Since exact millisecond processing is
unpractical, implementations MAY tolerate a small window around that
time for packets to be forwarded. That tolerance window SHOULD be kept
minimal.</p>
<p>Nodes MUST discard packets that have been delayed for significantly
more time than specified by the <code>NodeDelayCommand</code>.</p>
<h1 id="anonymity-considerations">5. Anonymity Considerations</h1>
<h2 id="topology">5.1 Topology</h2>
<p>Layered topology is used because it offers the best level of
anonymity and ease of analysis, while being flexible enough to scale up
traffic. Whereas most mixnet papers discuss their security properties in
the context of a cascade topology, which does not scale well, or a
free-route network, which quickly becomes intractable to analyze when
the network grows, while providing slightly worse anonymity than a
layered topology. <a href="#MIXTOPO10">MIXTOPO10</a></p>
<p>Important considerations when assigning mixes to layers, in order of
decreasing importance, are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Security: do not allow mixes from one security domain to be in
different layers to maximise the number of security domains traversed by
a packet</li>
<li>Performance: arrange mixes in layers to maximise the capacity of the
layer with the lowest capacity (the bottleneck layer)</li>
<li>Security: arrange mixes in layers to maximise the number of
jurisdictions traversed by a packet (this is harder to do really well
than it seems, requires understanding of legal agreements such as
MLATs).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mixing-strategy">5.2 Mixing strategy</h2>
<p>As a mixing technique the Poisson mix strategy <a
href="#LOOPIX">LOOPIX</a> and <a href="#KESDOGAN98">KESDOGAN98</a> is
used, which REQUIRES that a packet at each hop in the route is delayed
by some amount of time, randomly selected by the sender from an
exponential distribution. This strategy allows to prevent the timing
correlation of the incoming and outgoing traffic from each node.
Additionally, the parameters of the distribution used for generating the
delay can be tuned up and down depending on the amount of traffic in the
network and the application for which the system is deployed.</p>
<h1 id="security-considerations">6. Security Considerations</h1>
<p>The source of all authority in the mixnet system comes from the
Directory Authority system which is also known as the mixnet PKI. This
system gives the mixes and clients a consistent view of the network
while allowing human intervention when needed. All public mix key
material and network connection information is distributed by this
Directory Authority system.</p>
