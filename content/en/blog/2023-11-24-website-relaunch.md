To match all the code development in Katzenpost in the last year, it was time
for a website relaunch. Our site was a migration from Sphinx, which is primarily
for documentation, to Hugo which is wildly configurable for all sorts of
websites. Given the technical nature and need for nice documentation interface,
we used the well crafted and maintained Docsy theme.

**Website Dependencies**

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator
- [Docsy](https://docsy.dev) theme for Hugo
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com) is bundled in Docsy
- [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org) for a user-friendly GUI
