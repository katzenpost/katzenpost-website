The Katzenpost developement team has recently released a new golang
cryptography library known as [**hpqc**](https://github.com/katzenpost/hpqc). The theme of the library is
hybrid post quantum cryptographic constructions, namely:

* hybrid KEMs (key encapsulation mechanism)
* hybrid NIKEs (non-interactive key exchange)
* hybrid signature schemes

In each of the three main subdirectories, "kem", "nike" and "sign" there exists
interface definitions for `Scheme`, `PrivateKey` and `PublicKey`. For signature schemes and
KEMs we're borrowing the interface sets from cloudflare's circl library.

And each of these subdirectories has a `schemes` package where all the imeplementations are
registered and can be referenced by unique string name, take for examples the
[KEM schemes documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/katzenpost/hpqc@v0.0.17/kem/schemes).
However the implementations that are registered don't show up in the API docs but we can see
them in the [source code](https://github.com/katzenpost/hpqc/blob/main/kem/schemes/schemes.go).

**hpqc** gives you the power to compose an arbitrary number of KEMs and NIKEs, for example the
above source file defines many KEMs in composition like this one:


```golang
	combiner.New(
		"X25519-mlkem768-ctidh512",
		[]kem.Scheme{
			adapter.FromNIKE(x25519.Scheme(rand.Reader)),
			mlkem768.Scheme(),
			adapter.FromNIKE(ctidh512.Scheme()),
		},
	),
```


This library makes seven unique contributions in golang:


1. a set of generic NIKE interfaces for NIKE scheme, public key and private key types

[NIKE interfaces documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/katzenpost/hpqc@v0.0.17/nike)
[source code](https://github.com/katzenpost/hpqc/blob/main/nike/nike.go)

These are useful for making your cryptographic protocol not rely on a specific NIKE such
as an elliptic curve diffiehellman function like x25519 or x448.


2. generic hybrid NIKE, combines any two NIKEs into one

[NIKE hybrid scheme documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/katzenpost/hpqc@v0.0.17/nike/hybrid)
[source code](https://github.com/katzenpost/hpqc/blob/main/nike/hybrid/hybrid.go)

Many cryptographic protocols can use a hybrid post quantum NIKE in place of a NIKE.
Here the NIKE interfaces are satisfied by this hybrid scheme type.


3. security preserving KEM combiner

[security preserving KEM combiner documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/katzenpost/hpqc@v0.0.17/kem/combiner)
[source code](https://github.com/katzenpost/hpqc/blob/main/kem/combiner/combiner.go)

Our security preserving KEM combiner can combine an arbitrary number of KEMs althought it's
usually useful enough to combine just two KEMs. We get our design from the [KEM Combiners paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/024.pdf)
which makes the observation that if a KEM combiner is not security preserving then the
resulting hybrid KEM will not have IND-CCA2 security if one of the
composing KEMs does not have IND-CCA2 security. Likewise the paper
points out that when using a security preserving KEM combiner, if only
one of the composing KEMs has IND-CCA2 security then the resulting
hybrid KEM will have IND-CCA2 security.

Our KEM combiner uses the split PRF design for an arbitrary number
of KEMs, here shown with only three, in pseudo code:

```
func SplitPRF(ss1, ss2, ss3, cct1, cct2, cct3 []byte) []byte {
    cct := cct1 || cct2 || cct3
    return PRF(ss1 || cct) XOR PRF(ss2 || cct) XOR PRF(ss3 || cct)
}
```

4. a "NIKE to KEM adapter" which uses an ad hoc hashed elgamal construction

[NIKE to KEM adapter documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/katzenpost/hpqc@v0.0.17/kem/adapter)
[source code](https://github.com/katzenpost/hpqc/blob/main/kem/adapter/kem.go)

It is very common in modern hybrid post quantum cryptographic protocol constructions to see
a NIKE adapted into a KEM and then combined with a post quantum KEM.

Our ad hoc hashed elgamal construction for adapting any NIKE to a KEM is, in pseudo code:

```
func ENCAPSULATE(their_pubkey publickey) ([]byte, []byte) {
    my_privkey, my_pubkey = GEN_KEYPAIR(RNG)
    ss = DH(my_privkey, their_pubkey)
    ss2 = PRF(ss || their_pubkey || my_pubkey)
    return my_pubkey, ss2
}

func DECAPSULATE(my_privkey, their_pubkey) []byte {
    s = DH(my_privkey, their_pubkey)
    shared_key = PRF(ss || my_pubkey || their_pubkey)
    return shared_key
}
```

5. cgo bindings for the Sphincs+ C reference source

Our Sphincs+ wrapper conforms to the signature scheme interfaces:

[Sphincs+ signature scheme documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/katzenpost/hpqc@v0.0.17/sign/sphincsplus)
[source code](https://github.com/katzenpost/hpqc/blob/main/sign/sphincsplus/sphincs.go)

We maintain our Sphincs+ C reference fork and golang bindings in this git repo:
https://github.com/katzenpost/sphincsplus/

Here's the cgo bindings source code:
https://github.com/katzenpost/sphincsplus/blob/main/ref/binding.go


6. cgo bindings for the CTIDH C source

Our CTIDH golang bindings have been much improved through
collaboration and are now maintained by the Vula project in this git repo:

https://codeberg.org/vula/highctidh

hpqc currently has a wrapper type for each CTIDH key size, as documented here:

https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/katzenpost/hpqc@v0.0.17/nike/ctidh/ctidh511
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/katzenpost/hpqc@v0.0.17/nike/ctidh/ctidh512
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/katzenpost/hpqc@v0.0.17/nike/ctidh/ctidh1024
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/katzenpost/hpqc@v0.0.17/nike/ctidh/ctidh2048


7. generic hybrid signature scheme, combines any two signature schemes into one

It is useful to combine a classical signature scheme such as ed25519
with a post quantum signature scheme such as Sphincs+.
