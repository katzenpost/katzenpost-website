Modern Mixnets have a unique set of requirements when it comes to processing
audio. The bandwidth is scarce, but we expect to use modern devices and have
ample processing power. We aim to secure the communication against even
sophisticated attacks that come from capturing the metadata, and prioritize
tools that are free, open source and written with security in mind. In this
unique setting, we present a set of recommendations for implementing codecs,
DSPs, and sophisticated noise reduction tools, to deliver either impressive
quality at low bandwidth or good quality at impressively low bandwidth.
